# Movie Listing App

This is a React-based movie listing application that fetches and displays recent movies from a public movie API. The app presents movie data in a clean, user-friendly interface, allowing users to browse currently available or trending movies with essential details such as title, release date, and poster.

The application also includes a debounced search feature that lets users search for movies efficiently without triggering excessive API requests. By using debounce, the app improves performance and provides a smoother user experience while typing search queries. This project demonstrates practical use of React hooks, API integration, and frontend performance optimization techniques.
